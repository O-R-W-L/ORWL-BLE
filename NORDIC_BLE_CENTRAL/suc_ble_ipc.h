		Write Memory
		0x60 - 0x7F => reserved
		0x60 - 0x6B => Beacon Data Written by SuC
		0x5F - 0x5F => Beacon command written by SuC
		0x40 - 0x5E => 31 bytes of scan data that need to be used by Observer.
		               Dynamic update. Update every boot and as needed when rotation
		               determined by SuC

		Read Memory
		0x3F - 0x3F =>  reserved
		0x34 - 0x3E =>  Beacon Data
		0x33 - 0x33 =>  Beacon Command
		0x2B - 0x32 =>  Heart Beat info
		0x22 - 0x2A =>  ble device info
		0x1F - 0x21 =>  scan status list
		0x00 - 0x1E =>  Current 31 bytes of scan data used by BLE Observer

NOTE: SuC has to write on the write only region. Read only region will get
      updated accordingly. For example, to update the scan data used by
      Observer in the read only area(0x00), SuC has to write the scan data
      at write area(0x40). This is applicable for Beacon data and command
      also.
